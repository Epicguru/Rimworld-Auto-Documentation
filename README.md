## Info

Auto-generated 'documentation' of all vanilla and DLC defs. Intended as a tool to help modders and learners.
Should be used in conjunction with a good text editor i.e. VsCode and ideally a decompiler such as DnSpy.

This is closely based on [milon's orignal tool](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=21440.0). See that forum post for more information about this tool, the information there will apply here too.

Compared to milon's version this is completely re-writen in C#, and apart from visual changes, has a few more features.
Notably, you can see examples (def name and file name) of values. **If you download the generator** (or compile the source yourself), you can also make
the documentation **link to the actual source files**, allowing you to open them in a single click.
Values are sorted from smallest to largest, or alphabetically if the values are not numbers.
